    Astrometry.net allows you to access parts of the service through a JSON API.
    Your API key is required to do so, but allows the service to track your
    usage as if you were using the service through the website interface.
</p>
<p>
    To access the Astrometry.net API, first create a session by sending a JSON 
    request with your API key as the argument <span class="code">'apikey'</span> 
    to <span class="code">{% url 'astrometry.net.api.api_login' %}</span>. The
    API will return a session key, which must be included in subsequent
    requests sent to the API.
